1. How long did you spend working on this project?
About 10 hours.

2.What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
It was the implementation of the return product method by the Client.
While working on this, I was pushed to use several different ruby bloks.
Thanks to this experience I understood how extremely important is to know when, and how, to use this part of the language.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
a. Added possibility to display all transaction by customer.
Because I think it's pretty important feature for the customer.
Also seemed to me interesting, given the fact that customer data has been drawn from the transaction.

b. Added possibility to return product by customer
I added this possibility because in my opinion this is essential feature to any kind of commerce solution.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Object oriented design. Under what circumstances and which objects should interact with each other in a non-invasive way.
